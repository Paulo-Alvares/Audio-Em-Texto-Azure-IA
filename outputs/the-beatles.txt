Hey Jude, don't make it bad. Take a sad song and make it better. Remember to let everything to your heart.
Then you can start to make it better. Hey Jude, don't be afraid. You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin. And you begin to. To make it better. At anytime you feel the pain.
Hey, Jude, refrain. Don't carry the world upon your shoulders. For well, you know that it's a fool who
plays it cool. I'm making his world a little. Colder. Hey, June. Don't let me down. You have found hair.
Now go and get her and let it. Remember to let her into your heart. Then you can start to make it better.
So let it out and let it in. Hate, you Begin. You're waiting for someone. To perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you who hate you? You do. I'm a woman to me is on your shoulder.
Hate you? Rude. Don't make it fast. Take a sad song and make it better. Remember. To learn under your skin.
Then you begin to make it better, better, better, better. Hey dude. Hey.
