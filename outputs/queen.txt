Tonight I'm gonna have myself. A real good time, I feel like. Alive and. I'll turn it inside.
Out here I'm floating around. In ecstasy, so. 'Cause I'm having a good time. I'm a shooting star,
leaping through the sky like a tiger, defying the laws of gravity. I'm a racing car, passing by like
Lady Godiva. I'm going to go, go, go. There's no stopping me. I'm batted through the sky 200°, that's
why they call me Mr Farren Hide. I'm travelling at the speed of light. I don't want to make a supersonic
man out of you. I'm having such a good time. I'm having a bar. If you want to have a good time, just give
me a call because I'm having a good time. Yes, I'm having a good time. I don't want to stop at all.
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course. I am a satellite. I'm out of control.
I'm a sex machine ready to reload. Lagging atom bomb. A battle. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Explore. 
I'm burning through the sky here 200°. That's why they call me Mr Farren. Hi, I'm travelling at the speed
of light. I wanna make a supersonic woman. Have you? Hey, hey, hey. I like it. Have a good time.
Good time. Let loose, honey. All right. Burning through the sky 200°. That's why they call me Mr Fahrenheit.
Hey, travelling at the speed of light, I don't want to make a supersonic man out of you. Yeah, yeah.
Man, I'm having such a good time. I'm having a ball. If you want to have a good time, just give me a call.
Because I'm having a good time, Yes, I'm having a good time. I don't want to stop at. All.
